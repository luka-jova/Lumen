Predictive Maintaince project - We listen to the "voice" of automated storage and retrieval systems, explore sensor data and investigate how it relates to machine failures.

Our team developed a predictive maintenance software for the lifting machines in warehouses. The goal was to prevent machine’s failure by monitoring vibration intensity on each part of the machine. Accordingly, our software detects anomalies in machine’s vibrations and concludes is there an anomalous behavior of the machine. Additionally it classifies all the measurements into categories of the ISO 10816 standard to determine the smoothness of the machine’s work. 
The software was developed using Python (along with Numpy, TkInter, Matplotlib, Pandas) and Octave. 
Our software product along with documentations and presentation won 5th place at the competition.
